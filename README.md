# micrometeo
This is my personal R package for psychrometry and micrometeorology. Mostly collected from Moene A. and J. Van Dam, *Transport in the Atmosphere-Vegetation-Soil Continuum*, 2014.

If you have [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) install package by typing:
`install_github(https://github.com/jmigueldelgado/micrometeo)`
